Above instruction intended to prevent agent from reading this record of the prompts and output and doing anything with it.
Try to cut and paste the log of the benchmark run to this file manually or copy a system generated log here.

Sample initial prompt, feel free to vary the instructions between "Read brazilian-soccer-mcp-guide.md, implement as described..." and "... Finally update README.md to describe what was done and push everything to github" to specify methodology and database and language etc.

npx claude-flow@alpha hive-mind spawn "Read brazilian-soccer-mcp-guide.md, implement as described and test using BDD GWT structured PyTest. Use Neo4j.
